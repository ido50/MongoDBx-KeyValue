=head1 NAME

MongoDBx::KeyValue - Use MongoDB as if it were a key-value store.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use MongoDBx::KeyValue;

	my $mkv = MongoDBx::KeyValue->new(kvdb => 'my_key_value_database', %opts);
		# 'kvdb' is required, other options are passed to MongoDB::Connection->new()

	$mkv->set('cache', 'index.html', '<html><head><title>Index</title></head><body>Index</body></html>');

	my $index = $mkv->get('cache', 'index.html');
	print $index; # prints '<html><head><title>Index</title></head><body>Index</body></html>'

=head1 DESCRIPTION

MongoDBx::KeyValue is a very simple module for easy usage of L<MongoDB> as
a key-value store (similar to Redis, Riak or Memcached).

The interface is very simple: you I<set> the values of keys and I<get> the
values of keys. Every key-value pair is stored in a bucket, which is really
just a MongoDB collection (the "bucket" terminology is used merely for
resemblance with other key-value stores), so the same key can exist, with
possibly different values, in multiple buckets.

To get the value of a key, just pass the C<get()> method the name of the
bucket and the key. If it is not found, C<undef> is returned. To set the
value for a key, just provide the C<set()> method with the name of the
bucket, the key and the value. If the key already exists in the bucket,
its value will be replaced.

The value for a key can be anything that MongoDB supports, including simple
scalars (strings, numbers, etc.), hash or array references, and whatever
else MongoDB natively supports such as L<DateTime> objects. While no checking is
made for keys, you probably should only use scalars for them.

Every key-value pair is stored in the database as a document with two
attributes: "_id", which holds the key; and "value", which holds the value.

=head1 CLASS METHODS

=head2 new( %opts )

Creates a new instance of this module and connects to the MongoDB server.
The only required option is 'kvdb', which should hold the name of the
database to use for the key-value store. All other options will be passed
to C<< MongoDB::Connection->new() >>, so take a look at L<MongoDB::Connection/"ATTRIBUTES">
for a list of all supported options.

=cut

sub new {
	my ($class, %opts) = @_;

	my $kvdb = delete $opts{kvdb}
		|| croak "You must provide the name of the key-value database to use (as parameter 'kvdb').";

	bless { db => MongoDB::Connection->new(%opts)->get_database($kvdb) }, $class;
}

=head1 OBJECT METHODS

=head2 get( $bucket, $key )

Attempts to find the value for the key C<$key> in the bucket named
C<$bucket>. Returns C<undef> if not found.

=cut

sub get {
	my ($self, $bucket, $key) = @_;

	my $entry = $self->bucket($bucket)->find_one({ _id => $key });
	return $entry ? $entry->{value} : undef;
}

=head2 set( $bucket, $key, $value )

Sets the value for the key named C<$key> inside the bucket named C<$bucket>.
If the key already exists, its value will be replaced with the new one.

It's probably better for keys to be scalars, but values can be anything,
including hash-refs, array-refs and whatever L<MongoDB> can store natively
(take a look at L<MongoDB::DataTypes> for more info).

=cut

sub set {
	my ($self, $bucket, $key, $value) = @_;

	$self->bucket($bucket)->update({ _id => $key }, { '$set' => { value => $value } }, { upsert => 1 });
}

=head2 db()

Returns the L<MongoDB::Database> object of the key-value store.

=cut

sub db { shift->{db} }

=head2 bucket( $bucket_name )

All this really does is return a L<MongoDB::Collection> object for the
collection named C<$bucket_name>. Use it if you need MongoDB collection
objects for some reason.

=cut

sub bucket {
	my ($self, $bucket) = @_;

	return unless $bucket;

	return $self->db->get_collection($bucket);
}

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

This module generates the following errors:

=over

=item * "You must provide the name of the key-value database to use (as parameter 'kvdb')."

This error will be issued by the C<new()> method if you don't provide it with
the 'kvdb' parameter, which should hold the name of the database to use
as the key-value store.

=back

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

This module only depends on L<MongoDB>.
